                <p>As UX / UI Designer I am passionate about understanding the human interactions which are key for creating digital
            experiences that improve people‚Äôs lives in innovative ways. I‚Äôve been a Visual Designer for years which helped me
            develop visual storytelling and creative thinking.</p>
                <p>have many years of experience working for an American multinational indexed on the stock market, in their offices in
            Madrid, London, Marseille, Frankfurt and Texas.</p>

            <h2>My values</h2>
            <h3>üòç Passion is everything.</h3>
            <p>If you don't enjoy what you're doing - move. You are not a tree. Channel your energy into something you believe in. I'm
            fortunate to be inspired and surrounded by motivated people who enjoy what they do. We only have so much time on this
            earth to live - so why waste it?</p>
            <h3>ü§ì Always be learning.</h3>
            <p>Humans are constant works in progress that need to receive feedback in order to grow. I am always looking at ways to
            challenge and improve myself, which is why in my spare time I like to participate in hackathons, read blogs, dabble in
            new projects and attend meetups.</p>
            <h3>üé® Embrace your creativity.</h3>
            <p>Everyone needs a creative outlet of some sort - else, we'd go insane! When I'm not designing, I'm singing with the band,
            painting artworks as a form of meditation and helping startups realise their potential with design.</p>
            <h3>üôè Stay humble.</h3>
            <p>It doesn't matter whether you're the president, manager, homeless or average kid on the street. Treat others with
            respect as you would yourself because ultimately we're all human sharing the same wants and needs and facing our own
            battles everyday. Stay true to yourself and stay true to others.</p>
